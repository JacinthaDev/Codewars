# Codewars

Here you'll find daily uploads of daily uploads of my CodeWars challenges.

Throughout this journey I have tremendously increased my JavaScript skills and the understand of logic while coding as a whole. My goal with the creation of this propository was to make sure I'm coding everyday, just like to learn a language you must speak it everyday. After all there's no better way to learn than by doing, making mistakes, and trying again!
